## About

I've been looking for a good boilerplate for a React app. I've looked at several of them, but none of them quite nailed
all of what I would consider "good practices". This stack is heavily based off of
[react-redux-universal-hot-example](https://github.com/erikras/react-redux-universal-hot-example) by erikras
and takes most of its structure and a lot of its code. However, that example is from 2015, and many of the libraries
and dependencies used are out of date. Here, I've updated everything to very modern if not the latest versions.

## Installation

```bash
yarn install
```

or

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Depending on the size of the app, it may take a while for the initial Webpack build to complete
